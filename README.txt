BORING STUFF ABOUT THE OPTIONS IN THE OTHER PYTHON FILES

QUICK FAQ
~add stuff here~
Can't you just add all the .html files for all subjects and let us choose which ones to use instead of requiring a log in everytime?
Yup, perfectly capable of doing that, but it would be easier to just host that on the web all let people do that right? PM if you can get space somewhere to host those files

in the ignore list, is there a way to differentiate courses for 1 subject? I want to ignore MATH 223 but not CHEM 223.
Not implemented for now, but you can do it
